# Agentic <!-- omit from toc -->

Agentic is an open source, marketplace of curated LLM tools that work with every major LLM SDK and MCP client.

Developers can deploy their own APIs to Agentic's MCP Gateway and offer world-class MCP products in minutes.

You can think of Agentic as **RapidAPI for MCP servers**.

- [docs](https://docs.agentic.so)

## Key features

- **Highly Curated Tools**: All Agentic tools have been manually chosen to keep an extremely high quality bar.
- **Agentic UX**: All Agentic tools have been hand-crafted specifically for LLM tool use. We call this Agentic UX, and it's at the heart of why Agentic tools work better for LLM & MCP use cases than legacy APIs.
- **Production-Ready MCPs**: Forget random GitHub repos and gluing local MCP servers together. Agentic tools are all battle-tested in production and come with real SLAs.
- **World-Class TypeScript DX**: Agentic is written in TypeScript and strives for a Vercel-like DX, including one-line tool integrations all of the popular TS LLM SDKs: [**Vercel AI SDK**](https://docs.agentic.so/marketplace/ts-sdks/ai-sdk), [**OpenAI** Chat](https://docs.agentic.so/marketplace/ts-sdks/openai-chat) and [Responses](https://docs.agentic.so/marketplace/ts-sdks/openai-responses), [**LangChain**](https://docs.agentic.so/marketplace/ts-sdks/langchain), etc.
- **Stripe Billing**: Agentic uses Stripe for billing, and most tools are \_usage-based, so you'll only pay for what you (and your agents) actually use.
- **Blazing Fast MCP Gateway**: Agentic's MCP gateway is powered by _Cloudflare's global edge network_. Tools come with customizable caching and rate-limits, so you can REST assured that your agents will always have a fast and reliable experience.
- **Semver**: All Agentic tools are versioned using semver, so you can choose how to handle breaking changes.
