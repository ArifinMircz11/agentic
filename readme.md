## API Gateway

- **REST**: `GET/POST` `https://gateway.agentic.so/deploymentIdentifier/toolName`
- **MCP**: `https://gateway.agentic.so/deploymentIdentifier/mcp`

## TODO

- **webapp**
- stripe
  - stripe checkout
  - stripe billing portal

  - custom auth pages for `openauth`
- **API gateway**
  - oauth flow
    - https://docs.scalekit.com/guides/mcp/oauth
  - openapi-kitchen-sink
    - add more test cases to e2e tests
  - mcp-kitchen-sink
  - how to handle binary bodies and responses?
  - improve logger vs console for non-hono path and util methods
  - **test rate limiting**
  - **test usage tracking and reporting**
  - disallow `mcp` as a tool name or figure out another workaround
- **Public MCP server interface**
  - how does oauth work with this flow?
  - pass requestId to DurableMcpServer somehow on a per-request basis
- **Origin MCP servers**
  - how to guarantee that the request is coming from agentic?
    - `_meta` for tool calls
    - _still need a way of doing this for initial connection requests_

## TODO Post-MVP

- first-party deployment hosting
- api gateway stress tests
- auth
  - custom auth provider configs for projects/deployments
- stripe
  - re-add coupons
  - declarative json-based pricing
    - like https://github.com/tierrun/tier and Saasify
    - https://github.com/tierrun/tier/blob/main/pricing/schema.json
    - https://blog.tier.run/tier-hello-world-demo
  - stripe connect
  - stripe-related billing emails
- re-add support for teams / organizations
- consider switching to [consola](https://github.com/unjs/consola) for logging?
- consider switching to `bun` (for `--hot` reloading!!)
- validate stability of pricing plan slugs across deployments
  - same for pricing plan line-items
- replace `ms` package
- API gateway
  - **do we just ditch the public REST interface and focus on MCP?**
  - SSE support? (no; post-mvp if at all; only support [streamable http](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http) like smithery does, or maybe support both?)
  - signed requests
  - add support for custom headers on responses
  - add ability to only report stripe usage on non-cached requests
  - add support for ToolConfig.cost defaulting to 1, to easily support tools which cost multiple "credits"
  - extra `Sentry` instrumentation (`setUser`, `captureMessage`, etc)
- `@agentic/platform-hono`
  - fix sentry middleware
    - https://github.com/honojs/middleware/blob/main/packages/sentry/src/index.ts
    - https://github.com/honojs/middleware/issues/943
    - https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/tree/master/packages/cloudflare
- additional transactional emails
- consider `projectName` and `projectSlug` or `projectIdentifier`?
- handle or validate against dynamic MCP origin tools
- allow config name to be `project-name` or `@namespace/project-name`?
- upgrade to zod v4
