## TODO

- stripe
  - re-add coupons
  - declarative json-based pricing
    - like https://github.com/tierrun/tier and Saasify
    - https://github.com/tierrun/tier/blob/main/pricing/schema.json
    - https://blog.tier.run/tier-hello-world-demo
- auth
  - decide on approach for auth
    - built-in, first-party, tight coupling
    - https://www.better-auth.com
      - issues
        - doesn't allow dynamic social provider config
        - awkward schema cli generation and constraints
        - awkward cookie-only session support (need JWTs for CLI and SDK)
        - client uses dynamic proxy for methods which makes DX awkward
        - should be able to use custom `ky`-based client
        - drizzle pg adapter requires `Date` timestamps instead of default strings
    - https://github.com/toolbeam/openauth
    - https://github.com/aipotheosis-labs/aci/tree/main/backend/apps
    - https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango
    - https://github.com/transitive-bullshit?submit=Search&q=oauth&tab=stars&type=&sort=&direction=&submit=Search
    - clerk / workos / auth0
- consider switching to [consola](https://github.com/unjs/consola) for logging?
- consider switching to `bun` (for `--hot` reloading!!)
