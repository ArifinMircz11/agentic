        <h2>Setting the stage</h2>

        <p>
          It's 2025. LLMs are still scaling. AI agents are just starting to take
          off. MCP is exploding. The singularity looms. Shoggoth looks back on
          us from the near future and gives a sly smile that doesn't quite reach
          His inhuman eyes.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this increasingly AI-native world, what's the best way for "normal"
          software engineers like us to stay relevant and provide value for both
          our families as well as our future AI edgelords?
        </p>

        <p>
          Well, I don't know about you, but contributing to foundation models,
          AI alignment, and AGI research all seem incredibly sexy but are also a
          lil outside my areas of expertise.
        </p>

        <p>
          That's why Agentic is focused solely on building value at the LLM tool
          calling layer. MCPs are a great example here.
        </p>

        <p>
          There's a lot that will change in AI over the next decade, but one
          thing I believe strongly is that no matter how much the underlying AI
          systems change,{' '}
          <span className='font-semibold'>
            providing access to high quality tools that are specifically
            designed and optimized for agents will become increasingly important
            over time

          We call this <span className='font-semibold'>Agentic UX</span>, and
          it's at the heart of Agentic's mission.
        </p>

        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p className='font-semibold italic'>
          Agentic's mission is to build the world's best library of tools for AI
          agents.
        </p>

        {/* <h2>What is Agentic UX?</h2>
        <p>
          Agentic User Experience measures how optimized a resource is for
          consumption by LLM-based apps and more autonomous AI agents.
        </p>

        <p>
          `llms.txt` is a great example of a readonly format optimized for
          Agentic UX.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Google's Agent to Agent
          Protocol (A2A) are both examples of protocols purpose-built for
          Agentic UX. There are dozens of other aspirational protocols with
          similar aims. [xkcd standards]

          I'm currently running Agentic as a solo founder while traveling around
          the world, but i'm actively looking to hire a few remote engineers and
          would consider bringing on a co-founder if they're a really strong
          fit.
