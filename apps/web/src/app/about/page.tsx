          <p>Building reliable agents is hard.</p>

          <p>But building them without the right tools is even harder.</p>

          <p>
            MCP is really promising, but it's still early and the ecosystem's a
            bit of a mess.
          </p>

          <p>
            Add to that the fact that most MCPs are just thin wrappers around
            REST APIs â€“ which works, but is far from ideal in terms of context
            efficiency and instruction following.
          </p>

          <p>
            The best agents require their tools to be optimized for LLM usage
            with a fundamentally different UX than REST APIs.
          </p>

          <p>
            There's a lot that will change in AI over the next decade, but one
            thing I believe strongly is that no matter how much the underlying
            AI systems change,{' '}
            <span className='font-semibold'>
              providing access to high quality tools that are specifically
              designed and optimized for agents will become increasingly
              important

            We call this <span className='font-semibold'>Agentic UX</span>, and
            it's at the heart of Agentic's mission.
          </p>

          <h2>Mission</h2>
          <p className='font-semibold italic'>
            Agentic's mission is to provide the world's best library of tools
            for AI agents.
          </p>

          {/* <h2>What is Agentic UX?</h2>
        <p>
          Agentic User Experience measures how optimized a resource is for
          consumption by LLM-based apps and more autonomous AI agents.
        </p>

        <p>
          `llms.txt` is a great example of a readonly format optimized for
          Agentic UX.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Google's Agent to Agent
          Protocol (A2A) are both examples of protocols purpose-built for
          Agentic UX. There are dozens of other aspirational protocols with
          similar aims. [xkcd standards]

            I'm currently running Agentic as a solo founder while traveling
            around the world, but i'm actively looking to hire a few remote
            engineers and would consider bringing on a co-founder if they're a
            really strong fit.
