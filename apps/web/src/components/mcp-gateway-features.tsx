        Agentic uses immutable deployments, so every time you make a change to
        your product, a unique preview deployment is created. This enables
        instant rollbacks if there are problems with a deployment. Publishing
        uses <span className='font-semibold'>semver</span> (semantic
        versioning), so your customers can choose how to handle breaking
        changes.
