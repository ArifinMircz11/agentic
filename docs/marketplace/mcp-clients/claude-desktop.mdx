description: How to use Agentic tools with Claude Desktop as an MCP client.
---

Claude Desktop requires you to use [mcp-remote](https://github.com/geelen/mcp-remote) because it currently only supports local `stdio` MCP servers.

## Example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "@agentic/search": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://gateway.agentic.so/@agentic/search/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## DXT

Agentic tools don't currently support Anthropic's [Desktop Extensions (DXT)](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/desktop-extensions) format.
