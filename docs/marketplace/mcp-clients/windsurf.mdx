description: How to use Agentic tools with Windsurf as an MCP client.

Windsurf requires you to use [mcp-remote](https://github.com/geelen/mcp-remote) because [they do not support the Streamable HTTP Transport](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/mcp).

## Example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "@agentic/search": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://gateway.agentic.so/@agentic/search/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
