description: How to use Agentic tools with Cursor as an MCP client.

Go to: `Settings` -> `Cursor Settings` -> `MCP` -> `Add new global MCP server`

Pasting the following configuration into your Cursor `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file is the recommended approach. You may also install in a specific project by creating `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project folder. See [Cursor MCP docs](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol) for more info.

## Example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "@agentic/search": {
      "url": "https://gateway.agentic.so/@agentic/search/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```
