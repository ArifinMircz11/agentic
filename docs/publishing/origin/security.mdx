description: Agentic offers multiple ways to secure your origin server from unauthorized requests.
---

## Securing your origin server

Agentic's MCP Gateway will always pass a **proxy secret** when making tool calls to your origin server (either as [`_meta.agentic.agenticProxySecret` for MCP origin servers](/publishing/origin/metadata#mcp-origin-server) or as an [`x-agentic-proxy-secret` header for OpenAPI origin servers](/publishing/origin/metadata#open-api-origin-server)).

You can find this secret key in your Agentic project's dashboard settings.

You'll want to set this secret key in your origin server's environment variables and use it to protect against unauthorized requests.

Note that this is only necessary if your origin server is deployed externally to a public network.

### Securing an MCP origin server

This is example pseudocode for how you might protect your origin MCP server to ensure only calls from Agentic's MCP Gateway are allowed.

```ts
if (
  (_meta?.agentic as any)?.agenticProxySecret !==
  process.env.AGENTIC_PROXY_SECRET
) {
  return {
    content: [
      {
        type: 'text',
        text: 'Unauthorized'
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Securing an OpenAPI origin server

This is example pseudocode for how you might protect your origin OpenAPI service to ensure only calls from Agentic's MCP Gateway are allowed.

```ts
if (
  request.headers.get('x-agentic-proxy-secret') !==
  process.env.AGENTIC_PROXY_SECRET
) {
  return {
    status: 401,
    body: {
      error: 'Unauthorized'
    }
  }
}
```

## Restricting IP addresses

You can also protecting your origin server by restricting HTTP calls to specific IP addresses used by Agentic's MCP gateway.

This is currently a private beta feature. If you're interested in using it, please [get in touch](/contact).

## Signed HTTP requests

You can also protecting your origin OpenAPI server by requiring all HTTP requests to be signed with your project's proxy secret.

This is currently a private beta feature. If you're interested in using it, please [get in touch](/contact).

## Signed MCP requests

[MCP currently doesn't support signed requests](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/discussions/461).

If you're interested in this feature, please [get in touch](/contact).
