## Remote origin servers

**Agentic currently only supports remote origin servers**. If you're
interested in hosting your origin server with Agentic's infrastructure, please
[reach out to us](/contact) and we'll be happy to help you get set up.

<Note>
  Remote origin servers are important because they allow for maximum flexibility
  with how you author and host your MCP server or OpenAPI service.

By cleanly separating between Agentic's MCP gateway and your remote origin server, Agentic can support origin servers written in any language or frameworka and deployed to any cloud.

</Note>

### Remote Origin MCP Server

Agentic supports remote MCP servers hosted externally on any public network.

Your MCP server must support the Streamable HTTP transport and use a secure `https` URL.

See [Configuring your origin MCP server](/publishing/config#mcp-origin-server) for more details.

```ts agentic.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@agentic/platform'

export default defineConfig({
  name: 'Example remote MCP server',
  origin: {
    type: 'mcp',
    url: 'https://example.com/mcp'
  }
})
```

### Remote Origin OpenAPI Service

Agentic supports remote OpenAPI services hosted externally on any public network.

Your OpenAPI service must use OpenAPI 3.x and use a secure `https` URL.

See [Configuring your origin OpenAPI service](/publishing/config#open-api-origin-server) for more details.

```ts agentic.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@agentic/platform'

export default defineConfig({
  name: 'Example remote OpenAPI service',
  origin: {
    type: 'openapi',
    url: 'https://example.com/openapi',
    spec: 'https://example.com/openapi.json'
  }
})
```
