[xmcp](https://github.com/basementstudio/xmcp) is an excellent OSS TS framework for deploying MCP servers, with a familiar DX to Next.js and deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## 1. Create an xmcp server

<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: Please install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) before
  proceeding.
</Info>

```bash
npx create-xmcp-app@latest
```

Follow [xmcp's quickstart guide](https://xmcp.dev/docs#getting-started) for more details.

<Note>
  Make sure that the MCP server has the Streamable HTTP transport enabled (it's
  enabled by default).
</Note>

You should be able to run your MCP server locally with `xmcp dev` and see the
MCP server running at `http://localhost:3002/mcp`.

## 2. Deploy your MCP server remotely

Deploy your MCP server publicly (we recommend Vercel for xmcp):

```bash
xmcp build --vercel
```

```bash
vercel deploy --prod --prebuilt
```

## 4. Deploy your origin MCP server to Agentic

Now that you have a publicly available MCP server, you can follow the [existing MCP server guide](/publishing/guides/existing-mcp-server) to deploy it to Agentic.
