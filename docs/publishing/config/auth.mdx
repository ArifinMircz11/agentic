Ship to production fast with Agentic's free, hosted authentication. Email & password, OAuth, GitHub, Google, Twitter, etc â€“ if your origin API requires OAuth credentials, Agentic likely already supports it, and if not, [please let us know](/contact).

Currently, Agentic supports the following auth providers:

- Email & password
- GitHub

## How it works

Your product's users will sign into Agentic, subscribe to your product using Stripe, and then be given an API key to use with their tool calls.

Agentic's MCP gateway will then track all usage of your product based on API keys.

  <Tab title='MCP Origin Server'>
Agentic's MCP Gateway will always include the following metadata in all tool calls within the `_meta.agentic` field.

```ts
export type AgenticMcpRequestMetadata = {
  agenticProxySecret: string
  sessionId: string
  isCustomerSubscriptionActive: boolean

  customerId?: string
  customerSubscriptionStatus?: string
  customerSubscriptionPlan?: string

  userId?: string
  userEmail?: string
  userUsername?: string
  userName?: string
  userCreatedAt?: string
  userUpdatedAt?: string

  deploymentId: string
  deploymentIdentifier: string
  projectId: string
  projectIdentifier: string

  ip?: string
} & (
  | {
      // If the customer has an active subscription, these fields are guaranteed
      // to be present in the metadata.
      isCustomerSubscriptionActive: true

      customerId: string
      customerSubscriptionStatus: string

      userId: string
      userEmail: string
      userUsername: string
      userCreatedAt: string
      userUpdatedAt: string
    }
  | {
      // If the customer does not have an active subscription, then the customer
      // fields may or may not be present.
      isCustomerSubscriptionActive: false
    }
)
```

If a customer doesn't provide an API key, they'll default to your `free` pricing plan with `isCustomerSubscriptionActive` set to `false`.

## Alpha Features

### MCP OAuth

Agentic's MCP Gateway is designed to interop with MCP's built-in OAuth support, but this functionality is currently in alpha and not enabled publicly by default. If you're interested in using your origin server's MCP authentication support, [please let us know](/contact).

### Custom OAuth Providers

Agentic's MCP Gateway is designed to support any third-party OAuth provider (Google, Twitter / X, Slack, Airtable, Shopify, etc), but this functionality is currently in alpha and not enabled publicly by default.

If you're interested in using a different OAuth provider or want your customers to use your own OAuth client credentials or custom scopes, [please let us know](/contact).
