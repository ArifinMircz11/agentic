Ship to production fast with Agentic's free, hosted authentication. Email & password, OAuth, GitHub, Google, Twitter, etc â€“ if your origin API requires OAuth credentials, Agentic likely already supports it, and if not, [please let us know](/contact).

Currently, Agentic supports the following auth providers:

- Email & password
- GitHub

## How it works

Your product's users will sign into Agentic, subscribe to your product using Stripe, and then be given an API key to use with their tool calls.

Agentic's MCP gateway will then track all usage of your product based on API keys.

See [Origin Metadata](/publishing/origin-metadata) for details on how Agentic's MCP gateway passes customer auth and subscription information to your origin server.

## Alpha Features

### MCP OAuth

Agentic's MCP Gateway is designed to interop with MCP's built-in OAuth support, but this functionality is currently in alpha and not enabled publicly by default. If you're interested in using your origin server's MCP authentication support, [please let us know](/contact).

### Custom OAuth Providers

Agentic's MCP Gateway is designed to support any third-party OAuth provider (Google, Twitter / X, Slack, Airtable, Shopify, etc), but this functionality is currently in alpha and not enabled publicly by default.

If you're interested in using a different OAuth provider or want your customers to use your own OAuth client credentials or custom scopes, [please let us know](/contact).
