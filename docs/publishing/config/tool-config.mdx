title: Tool Config
description: Configure tool-specific settings for your project.
---

`toolConfigs` is an optional array of tool configs which may be used to override the default gateway behavior for specific tools.

With `toolConfigs`, tools can be disabled, set custom rate-limits, customize reporting usage for metered billing, and they can also override behavior for different pricing plans.

For example, you may want to disable certain tools on a `free` pricing plan or remove the rate-limit for a specific tool on a `pro` pricing plan while keeping the defualt rate-limit in place for other tools.

Note that tool-specific configs override the defaults defined in pricing plans.

If a tool is defined on the origin server but not specified in `toolConfigs`, it will use the default behavior of the Agentic MCP gateway.

## Tool Config

<ResponseField name='name' type='string' required>
  The name of the tool, which acts as a unique, stable identifier for the tool
  across deployments.

Make sure the tool `name` matches the origin server's tool names, either via its MCP server or OpenAPI operationIds.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name='enabled' type='boolean' default='true'>
Whether this tool should be enabled for all customers (default).

If you want to hide a tool from customers but still have it present on your origin server, set this to `false` for the given tool.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name='pure' type='boolean' default='false'>
Whether this tool's output is deterministic and idempotent given the same input.

If `true`, tool outputs will be cached aggressively for identical requests, though origin server response headers can still override this behavior on a per-request basis.

If `false`, tool outputs will be cached according to the origin server's response headers on a per-request basis.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name='cacheControl' type='string'>
A custom `Cache-Control` header to use for caching this tool's responses.

If set, this field overrides `pure`.

If not set and `pure` is `true`, the gateway will default to: `public, max-age=31560000, s-maxage=31560000, stale-while-revalidate=3600` (cache publicly for up to 1 year).

If not set and `pure` is `false`, the gateway will default to `no-store` which will disable caching. This is the default gateway behavior for tools (no caching).

Note that origin server response headers may also choose to disable caching on a per-request basis.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name='reportUsage' type='boolean' default='true'>
Whether calls to this tool should be reported as usage for the default `requests` line-item's metered billing.

Note: This is only relevant if the customer's active pricing plan includes a `requests` line-item.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name='rateLimit' type='object'>
Customize the default `requests`-based rate-limiting for this tool.

To disable rate-limiting for this tool, set `rateLimit.enabled` to `false`.

If not set, the default rate-limiting for the active pricing plan will be used.

See [Rate Limits](/publishing/config/rate-limits) for details.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name='inputSchemaAdditionalProperties' type='boolean'>
Whether to allow additional properties in the tool's input schema.

The default MCP spec allows additional properties. Set this to `false` if you want your tool to be more strict.

Note: This is only relevant if the tool has defined an `inputSchema`.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name='outputSchemaAdditionalProperties' type='boolean'>
Whether to allow additional properties in the tool's output schema.

The default MCP spec allows additional properties. Set this to `false` if you want your tool to be more strict.

Note: This is only relevant if the tool has defined an `outputSchema`.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name='pricingPlanOverrides' type='object'>
Allows you to override this tool's behavior or disable it entirely for different pricing plans.

This is a map from PricingPlan `slug` to PricingPlanToolOverride.

```ts agentic.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@agentic/platform'

// In this example, `my-tool` is disabled for the `free` pricing plan.
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  toolConfigs: [
    {
      name: 'my-tool',
      pricingPlanOverridesMap: {
        free: {
          enabled: false
        }
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

<Expandable title="PricingPlanToolOverride">
  <ResponseField name='enabled' type='boolean'>
    Whether this tool should be enabled for the given pricing plan.

    If `undefined`, will use the tool's default enabled state.

  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name='reportUsage' type='boolean'>
    Whether to report default `requests` usage for metered billing for customers on a given pricing plan.

    Note: This is only relevant if the pricing plan includes a `requests` line-item.

    If `undefined`, will use the tool's default reportUsage state.

  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name='rateLimit' type='object'>
Customize or disable rate limits for this tool for customers on a given pricing plan.

To disable rate-limiting for this tool on a given pricing plan, set `rateLimit.enabled` to `false`.

See [Rate Limits](/publishing/config/rate-limits) for details.
