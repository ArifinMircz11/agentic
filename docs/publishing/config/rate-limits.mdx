title: Rate Limits
description: Configure rate-limits for your product.

Agentic's durable rate-limiting is built on top of Cloudflare's global infrastructure. Customize the default rate-limits, change them based on a customer's pricing plan, or create custom tool-specific overrides.

## Rate Limit

<ResponseField name='enabled' type='boolean' required>
  Whether or not this rate limit is enabled.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="interval" type="string" required>
  The interval at which the rate limit is applied.

Either a positive integer expressed in seconds or a valid positive [ms](https://github.com/vercel/ms) string (eg, `10s`, `1m`, `8h`, `2d`, `1w`, `1y`, etc).

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name='limit' type='number' required>
  The maximum number of API requests per interval (unitless).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="mode" type="string" default="approximate">
  How to enforce the rate limit: `strict` (more precise but slower) or `approximate` (the default; faster and asynchronous but less precise).

The default rate-limiting mode is `approximate`, which means that requests
are allowed to proceed immediately, with the limit being enforced
asynchronously in the background. This is faster than `strict` mode, but it is less consistent if precise adherence to rate-limits is required.

With `strict` mode, customer requests are blocked until the current limit has
been confirmed. The downside with this approach is that it introduces
more latency to every request by default. The advantage is that it is
more precise and consistent.

## Example Rate Limits

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Default">

The default platform rate limit for `requests` is a limit of 1000 requests per minute per customer.

```ts
{
  enabled: true,
  interval: '1m',
  limit: 1000,
  mode: 'approximate'
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Strict daily">

This example rate limit restricts customers to 100 requests per day. It uses `strict` mode which adds a little extra latency but guarantees that customers will never exceed the limit.

```ts
{
  enabled: true,
  interval: '1d',
  limit: 100,
  mode: 'strict'
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Disabled">

This is an example of a disabled rate limit.

```ts
{
  enabled: false
}
```

</Tab>
