title: Config Overview
description: Configuring your Agentic project.
---

Every Agentic project needs a config file (`agentic.config.ts`, `agentic.config.js`, or `agentic.config.json`) to define the project's metadata, pricing, rate-limits, and any tool-specific behavior overrides.

<Tip>
  Configuring your project can feel a little overwhelming. Feel free to [reach
  out to us](/contact) if you're considering using Agentic's MCP Gateway, and
  I'd be happy to help walk you through setting your product up for success.

Unique project slug.

Must be ascii-only, lower-case, and kebab-case with no spaces between 1 and 256 characters.

The project's fully qualified identifier will be `@namespace/slug`, where
the `namespace` is determined by the author's `username` or team slug.

If not provided, it will be derived by slugifying `name`.

<ResponseField name='description' type='string' required>
  Short description of the project.

Should be no longer than a few lines.

Examples: `1.0.0`, `0.0.1`, `5.0.1`, etc.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name='readme' type='string'>
  Optional markdown readme documenting the project (supports GitHub-flavored markdown).

A string which may be either: a URL to a remote markdown file (eg, `https://example.com/readme.md`), a local file path (eg, `./readme.md`), or a data-uri string (eg, `data:text/markdown;base64,SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ=`).

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name='iconUrl' type='string'>
Optional logo image to use for the project. Logos should have a square aspect ratio.

A string which may be either: a URL to a remote image (eg, `https://example.com/logo.png`), a local file path (eg, `./logo.png`), or a data-uri string (eg, `data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA...`).

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name='sourceUrl' type='string'>
  Optional URL to the source code of the project (eg, GitHub repo).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name='homepageUrl' type='string'>
  Optional URL to the product's website.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name='origin' type='object' required>
  Origin API adapter used to configure the origin API server downstream from
  Agentic's MCP gateway.

<Expandable title="properties" defaultOpen>
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="MCP origin server">
    <ResponseField name="type" type="string" required>
      The type of origin server. `mcp` in this case.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="url" type="string" required>

Required base URL of the externally hosted origin MCP server.

This URL must be accessible from Agentic's MCP gateway and support the Streamable HTTP transport.

Must be a valid `https` URL.

</ResponseField>

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="OpenAPI origin server">
    <ResponseField name="type" type="string" required>
      The type of origin server. `openapi` in this case.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="url" type="string" required>

Required base URL of the externally hosted origin API server.

</Tabs>
</Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name='pricingPlans' type='array'>
  List of PricingPlans configuring which Stripe subscriptions should be available for the project.

Defaults to a single free plan which is useful for developing and testing your project.

See [PricingPlan](/publishing/config/pricing#pricing-plan) for details.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name='pricingIntervals' type='array'>
Optional list of billing intervals to enable in pricing plans.

Defaults to a single monthly interval `['month']`.

To add support for annual pricing plans, for example, you can use:
`['month', 'year']`.

Note that for every pricing interval, you must define a corresponding set
of PricingPlans in the `pricingPlans` array. If you only have one pricing
interval (like the default `month` interval), `pricingPlans` don't need to
specify their `interval` property. Otherwise, all PricingPlans must
specify their `interval` property to differentiate between different
pricing intervals.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name='defaultRateLimit' type='object'>
Optional default rate limits to enforce across all pricing plans.

If not set, a default platform rate-limit of 1000 requests per minute per customer will be used.

To disable the default rate-limit, set `defaultRateLimit.enabled` to
`false`.

Note that pricing-plan-specific rate-limits override this default (via
`pricingPlans`), and tool-specific rate-limits may override both default
and pricing-plan-specific rate-limits (via `toolConfigs`).

See [Rate Limits](/publishing/config/rate-limits) for more details.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name='toolConfigs' type='array'>
Optional list of tool configs to override the default behavior of specific tools.

See [Tool Config](/publishing/config/tool-config) for details.
