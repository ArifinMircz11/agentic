<Steps>
  <Step title='Create your MCP server or OpenAPI service'>
    Your origin server represents your product's unique value prop.

    It can be any remote MCP server or OpenAPI service. You can host your origin server anywhere, using any language or framework.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish your origin server to Agentic's MCP Gateway">
    Agentic's MCP Gateway acts as a public proxy between your origin
    server and your customers.

    It handles everything you'll need to start charging for your tools as a production-ready AI product. That includes auth, billing, rate-limiting, caching, usage tracking, versioning, etc. It also makes your tools instantly compatible with every major LLM SDK and MCP client.

  </Step>
  <Step title='Share your MCP product with the world! ðŸŽ‰'>
    Your MCP product is now live and ready to sell. You can share its public URL
    with customers, and they'll be able to subscribe to your product via Stripe.
    We use [Stripe Connect](https://stripe.com/connect) to handle sending
    payments to your bank.

That's all there is to it!
